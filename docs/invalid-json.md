This is the standard error message you will see for this error:

![invalid-json](/reference-images/jsonError.png)

This is one of two things:

- Trade site is down
- A stricter bot protection is enabled on the trade site currently

Before reporting this issue, please check if the trade site is down. If it is not those, please be incredibly detailed in the bug report, since this is commonly mis-reported when it was in fact a bot protection issue or trade site issue.
