title: Too Complex Query
---

This is the standard error message you will see for this error:

![complex](/reference-images/complex.png)

Either you have to log in using the built-in browser to raise the limit, reduce the query(remove total ele res), or open the query in your default browser.

Hitting "Browser" from the error message will open in the built-in browser.

To open in your default browser, hit the arrow to the right of "trade" before searching the item. Selecting "Trade" will open the trade page in the built-in browser.

If there are further issues, or you don't want to use the builtin browser for auth, disable the "Use Pseudo" option in settings. (under Price Check)
